        <h2 class="color-blue">History</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">BUSHIDO, C.A. is a familiar business founded by Mrs. Ligia Arocha de Pabón in 1983. Ten years later, in 1993, Luis Madera Pabón and Richard Pabón López decided to integrate this company. The main purpose of BUSHIDO, C.A. is to make and to distribute; uniforms, belts and accessories for Martial Arts (Karate, Judo, Taekwondo and Wrestling).
            In 1997, BUSHIDO started with the exclusive importing process and distribution of an important variety of products; therefore, with the inclusion of these new areas, we have expanded BUSHIDO into a general provider specialized in Martial Arts sports in Venezuela.
            
            As the result of being the first company in this market; we are recognized as the providing leader of uniforms and Martial Arts equipment due to our quality and to our competitive prices.</p>
        <h2 class="color-blue">Brand</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">From the beginning, all of our products were produced and protected by our brand “BUSHIDO” which was registered in the Autonomous Intellectual Property Service (SAPI). Bushido is a Japanese word and it means: Honor Code. This is a name given to the Warrior Samurai from the upper caste.


            Since 1983, BUSHIDO, C.A. has produced Martial Arts equipment such as uniforms, belts, gloves, punching bags, cushions, etc. Over the years we have stablished BUSHIDO, C.A. as a quality brand where our products are tough and durable. Our company works as a market leader and provides the equipment to 520 sport stores. This data let us appreciate the selling power in our country with the 70% success in all stores in Venezuela. We are also glad to know that almost all the athletes prefer to wear BUSHIDO’s equipment.
            
            
            BUSHIDO’S goal is to initiate a large-scale exporting process. We consider that USA (Florida, Texas) Central America, South America, and the Caribbean are feasible alternative to begin in a short term the exporting process of uniforms and accessories that are being produced with the same quality and durability which is a result of 30 years of experience.
            
            A good advantage of our company is that we have the specific material for the production of the kimonos and the experience in the production of Karateguis that are recognized by the athletes because of its strength, durability, quality and price. BUSHIDO, C.A. has the complete technology to produce 1000 Karateguis monthly.
            
            This is possible because the factory has the digitalized pattern cutting system which allows us to save material and work with the 60% of production to stablish in the exporting market.</p>    
        <h2 class="color-blue">Mission</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">We want to be recognized around the world because our quality, durability and price of our products. BUSHIDO C.A. is the first Venezuelan company with the goal to satisfy the customers’ requirements in order to exceed expectations of the athletes who wear BUSHIDO’s.</p>
        <h2 class="color-blue">Vision</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">To export our products on a large-scale to place BUSHIDO C.A. in a national and international market to compete in the market. To exceed the expectations of the athletes by studying their needs in everyday practicing of Martial Arts.</p>
